# Requirments
python 3.8 or above the version used was 3.12.3 using WSL on windows or using linux 
natively is completly up to you i prefer linux at this point as it is easier in some cases

to create a virtual enviroment use the following command 
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
the second venv is the name of the virtual enviroment you can change it to any name you like
to activate the virtual enviroment use the following command 
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
on windows use the following command
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
after activating the virtual enviroment you need to install the requirments using the following command 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
